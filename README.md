## Welcome to the "Who's Gene is it Anyway" Repo

This is the collection of all the plasmids designed during the "who's gene is it anyway" live streams.

These plasmids are released as creative commons fair use. You may download them, modify them, even have them synthesized if you so choose. The only requirement is that you give attribution to The Thought Emporium and whoever was helping to design the plasmid during the stream.
