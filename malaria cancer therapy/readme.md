#Project Overview
This project focuses on using a malarial protein (var2csa) fused with the Fc segment of human IgG1 antibody and the secretory signal from IgG2 to act as an immunotherapy for treating cancers. Curerntly this is based on a lentiviral vector but other vectors are possible as well. The truncated var2csa (denoted rVar2) binds to glycosoaminoglycans that are only found on cancer cell lines and human placenta. However the number of different cancer varieties it binds to is quite simply staggering. This plasmid will be synthesized and made availiable as soon as possible, and is planned for animal testing as soon as reasonably possible as well.

The plasmid called "definitly not zombie serum v1" is the same as "pLV-EF1a-IRES-Puro rvar2 igg1 fc igg2 secretion". Both are the current final version of the plasmid, but it's such a serious project it felt only right to have a little fun. Contributors who can make suggestions for improvements are encouraged to submit pull requests.
